# LeetCode Questions & Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode journey! I’m adding new LeetCode problems and their solutions here every day, coded in languages like Python, C++, and Java. This repo is all about sharpening problem-solving skills and mastering algorithms for coding interviews or just for fun.

## What’s Here
- **Daily Problems**: Fresh LeetCode questions with clear, optimized solutions.
- **Multiple Approaches**: Where possible, I include different ways to solve each problem (e.g., brute force, optimized, or tricky one-liners).
- **Organized**: Problems are sorted by topic (arrays, strings, trees, etc.) and difficulty (easy, medium, hard).

## How to Use
- Browse the folders to find problems by topic or difficulty.
- Each solution has comments explaining the logic and time/space complexity.
- Try solving first, then check my code for hints or better approaches!
