## How to Get Started

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Click "Fork" at [github.com/XynaxDev/Leetcode-Questions](https://github.com/XynaxDev/Leetcode-Questions).

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   - Clone to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/XynaxDev/Leetcode-Questions.git
     ```

3. **Create a Branch:**
   - Make a new branch for your work
        ```bash
        git checkout -b problem-123-solution
        ```
4. **Make Changes:**
    - **Add a Problem:** Create a file like arrays/001-two-sum.py with the problem description, solution, and comments on logic.
    - **Improve a Solution:** Optimize code or add a new approach (e.g., trees/104-max-depth.cpp).
    - **Fix Issues:** Update incorrect code or docs.
    - **Stick to the folder structure:** `topic/difficulty/problem-number-name.extension` (e.g., strings/easy/020-valid-parentheses.cpp).

5. **Test Your Work:**
    - Verify solutions pass LeetCode tests.
    - Ensure code is readable with comments (e.g., time/space complexity).
  
6. **Commit:**
   - **Use a clear message:**
        ```bash 
        git add .
        git commit -m "Add Two Sum solution in Python"
        ```
7. **Push:**
   - **Push your branch:**
        ```bash
        git push origin problem-123-solution
        ```
8. **Submit a Pull Request:**
    - Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request."
    - Explain your changes (e.g., “Added O(n) solution for Two Sum”).
    - Target the `main` branch.


## Contribution Guidelines
- **Code Quality:** Include comments for clarity. Mention complexity (e.g., “Time: O(n), Space: O(1)”).
- **File Structure:** Organize by topic (arrays, strings, etc.) and difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
- **No Duplicates:** Only add new solutions if they’re unique (e.g., different language or approach).
- **Test First:** Solutions must pass LeetCode’s test cases.
- **Keep It Friendly:** Be respectful in PRs and issues.
